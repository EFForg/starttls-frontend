We've sent you an e-mail to confirm that you really do want to add your domain to the list!

Once you confirm your email, your domain will be queued for addition on **<span class="next-queue-date">Wednesday</span>**. Your domain will be added to the STARTTLS Policy List as long as it has continued to pass our tests!

Remember read [our guidelines]() about the requirements your mailserver must meet, and continue to meet, in order to stay on the list. If your mailserver ceases to meet these requirements at any point and is at the risk of facing deliverability issues, we will notify you through this email address.

Thanks for helping us secure email for everyone :)
