Email typically makes more than one hop in order to be delivered.
Let’s say you have an email address @gmail.com. You open your email client, which might be a desktop app like Thunderbird or Outlook, a mobile app, or a website in your browser, like Gmail and Yahoo both provide.

Then you draft an email to your friend, who has an email address @eff.org. What happens when you press “SEND”?

1.  Your email is sent to and queued for delivery at Gmail’s email
    servers.
2.  Then, Gmail transmits your email to EFF’s email servers, where the
    email stays and waits until your friend opens their own mail client.
3.  Your friend’s mail client then asks EFF’s mail server whether they
    have any outstanding mail, and EFF transmits the relevant messages
    to your friends computer.
