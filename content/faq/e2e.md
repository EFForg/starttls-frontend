No, STARTTLS only secures communication between mailservers (hop 2 in this figure). Even if each of your hops are secured and encrypted, your email provider, like Gmail and Yahoo, can still read your email. If youâ€™ve heard of PGP, PGP encryption can provide end-to-end encryption for you, although it can be difficult to use. If you want to take advantage of all the benefits of end-to-end encrypted messaging, check out our series on <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/secure-messaging-more-secure-mess" target="_blank">Secure Messaging</a>.
