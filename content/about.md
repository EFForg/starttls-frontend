STARTTLS Everywhere is a project to finally secure the delivery of email. It is created and maintained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a 501(c)3 nonprofit.

We want to increase STARTTLS adoption, increase the number of mailservers that actually validate certificates, and offer a STARTTLS Policy List to help prevent downgrade attacks on email services.

If you have questions about how STARTTLS Everywhere works, check out our FAQ. If you are an email service provider and are looking to be added to the STARTTLS Everywhere policy list, check out our guidelines here.

<h5>Statistics</h5>

In 2015, researchers discovered that ~20% of the Alexa top million domains which have mailservers donâ€™t use STARTTLS, and ~40% present invalid certificates <sup>[1]</sup>. In addition, STARTTLS commands from several countries were being regularly downgraded, as high as 96% of the time.

These results are the motivation for this project.
