  <p>STARTTLS Everywhere also maintains <strong><a href="/policy-list">the STARTTLS policy list</a></strong>, a list of domains that support strong security, so bad actors are less likely to interfere with your secure connections. If your server passes all our checks, add it to the list!</p>
  <p>Even if you pass the above checks, someone sitting between your server and other mailservers can choose to drop “STARTTLS” messages and fool servers into thinking that you do not support TLS.</p>
  <p>To prevent this from happening, if you pass all the previous checks, you can add your domain to our index of high-security email domains so servers have another point of reference to discover that you support STARTTLS encryption.</p>
