  <h2>Your email domain is queued to be added to the STARTTLS policy list! Weâ€™ll contact you by e-mail when this occurs, or you can check back here.</h2>

  <p>To mitigate downgrade attacks, <a href="https://dl.eff.org/starttls-everywhere/policy.json">you've added your domain to our index of high-security e-mail domains</a>, so servers have another point of reference to discover that you support STARTTLS.</p>
